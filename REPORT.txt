- How did you design your benchmarks?

We binary searched on the size to read in for all of the benchmarks. 
We used binary search since we knew that there existed a point where one would be faster than the other and we needed to find it.
We tried a large file and then a small file but both favored the same type. Thus we knew to try the middle.


- What performance differences did you see?

We saw that demand paging and 4kb only is favored in extreme file sizes (both large and small).

- If you have time / interest, lets try to look at what exactly caused these
performance differences above. Our hardware has special performance counters
for measuring certain events such as number of cache misses, cycles per
instruction, etc. We can use these counters ourselves using the perf
commandline tool. `perf list` will print a list of all the counters your
hardware + OS support. Which counters did you find most interesting? What
results did you observe?

Unfortunately we did not have the time nor interest in doing so. Our binary search technique was too slow so we think we need to optimize our ML model.
